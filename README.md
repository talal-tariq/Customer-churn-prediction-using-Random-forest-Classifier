Welcome to the Credit Card Fraud Detection Project, an open-source solution for identifying and preventing fraudulent credit card transactions using the Random Forest algorithm. This project aims to provide a robust and reliable system to detect and mitigate credit card fraud, ensuring the safety and security of cardholders' financial transactions.

# Project Overview:
The Credit Card Fraud Detection Project employs machine learning techniques, specifically the Random Forest algorithm, to analyze transaction data and flag potentially fraudulent activities. With the increasing prevalence of credit card fraud, this project is designed to help financial institutions and consumers in safeguarding their financial assets.

# Key Features:

**Random foest model** The repository contains a Random Forest machine learning model that has been trained on a dataset of credit card transactions. This model is capable of identifying fraudulent transactions in real-time.

**Data Preprocessing:** Included in the repository are scripts for data preprocessing, which clean and prepare the dataset for the machine learning model. This process includes feature engineering and data transformation.

**Jupyter Notebooks:** Explore Jupyter notebooks that provide detailed insights into model development, feature selection, evaluation, and analysis of the results.

**Model Evaluation:** Performance metrics for the Random Forest model are showcased, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC curves.
**Dataset:** The dataset used for training and evaluation is provided for transparency and reproducibility.
